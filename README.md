# Single-Cycle-Architecture
This repository implements a **Single Cycle Processor Architecture**, executing one instruction per clock cycle. It supports R-type, I-type, S-type, B-type, JAL, JALR, and U-type instructions. Key components include PC, ALU, and Control Unit, making it ideal for learning CPU basics despite limited efficiency for complex tasks.
